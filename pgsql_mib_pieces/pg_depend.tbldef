pg_depend	"The catalog pg_depend records the dependency relationships between database objects. This information allows DROP commands to find which other objects must be dropped by DROP CASCADE or prevent dropping in the DROP RESTRICT case. See also pg_shdepend, which performs a similar function for dependencies involving objects that are shared across a database cluster."
