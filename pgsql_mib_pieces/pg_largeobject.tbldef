pg_largeobject	"The catalog pg_largeobject holds the data making up 'large objects'. A large object is identified by an OID assigned when it is created. Each large object is broken into segments or 'pages' small enough to be conveniently stored as rows in pg_largeobject. The amount of data per page is defined to be LOBLKSIZE (which is currently BLCKSZ/4, or typically 2 kB)."
