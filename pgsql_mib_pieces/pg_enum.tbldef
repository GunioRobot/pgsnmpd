pg_enum	"The pg_enum catalog contains entries matching enum types to their associated values and labels. The internal representation of a given enum value is actually the OID of its associated row in pg_enum. The OIDs for a particular enum type are guaranteed to be ordered in the way the type should sort, but there is no guarantee about the ordering of OIDs of unrelated enum types."
